# Revised 7-Day MVP Development Plan

## Day 1: Core Analysis & Completion of the Python Backend

### Priority Tasks
- [x] ~~Set up MediaPipe pose detection~~ (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
- [x] ~~Create embedding generation~~ (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
- [x] ~~Configure Pinecone database~~ (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
- [ ] Fix Pinecone environment setting in `config/settings.py`
- [ ] Verify the `.mpg` file handling in `populate_database.py`
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow with sample videos from your dataset
- [ ] Implement basic gait metrics calculation (stride length, cadence)

### Implementation Notes
- You already have `PoseExtractor`, `GaitEmbeddingGenerator`, and `GaitDatabase` classes
- Your `populate_database.py` script already handles video processing
- Update the `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT` in `config/settings.py` with your actual environment

## Day 2: Python FastAPI Service Creation

### Priority Tasks
- [ ] Create a new FastAPI application for video analysis
- [ ] Implement video upload endpoint with MediaPipe processing
- [ ] Create endpoint for gait comparison
- [ ] Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Test API with sample requests

### Implementation Notes
- Create a new file `fastapi_server.py` that leverages your existing classes
- Add proper error handling for video processing failures
- Support video uploads and conversion to the correct format

## Day 3: Node.js/Express Backend Integration

### Priority Tasks
- [ ] Set up Express server with routing
- [ ] Implement middleware for file uploads
- [ ] Create proxy endpoints to FastAPI service
- [ ] Add basic authentication if required
- [ ] Test Express endpoints with Postman/cURL

### Implementation Notes
- The Express server will primarily handle web traffic and file uploads
- The Python FastAPI service will handle the ML processing
- Configure CORS to allow frontend requests

## Day 4: React Frontend Kickoff

### Priority Tasks
- [ ] Create React project with Vite
- [ ] Set up routing and basic navigation
- [ ] Implement video upload component
- [ ] Create API service for backend communication
- [ ] Test file upload and basic interaction

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Implement progress indicators for long-running processes
- Set up proper error handling for failed uploads/processing

## Day 5: Gait Analysis Visualization

### Priority Tasks
- [ ] Create components for gait metrics display
- [ ] Implement visualizations for key measurements
- [ ] Add comparison view for reference data
- [ ] Style the interface for usability
- [ ] Test with sample analysis results

### Implementation Notes
- You can leverage code from `src/utils/visualization.py`
- Focus on just a few key metrics for the MVP (stride length, symmetry)
- Use simple charts/graphs for clear data visualization

## Day 6: Integration and Testing

### Priority Tasks
- [ ] Connect all components end-to-end
- [ ] Test full user flows from upload to results
- [ ] Fix critical bugs and performance issues
- [ ] Implement proper error handling throughout
- [ ] Test with various video inputs and edge cases

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on the happy path first, then address edge cases
- Use the existing sample videos in `data/raw/reference_gaits/`
- Verify Pinecone search is returning relevant results

## Day 7: Final Polishing

### Priority Tasks
- [ ] Address any remaining critical issues
- [ ] Optimize performance for video processing
- [ ] Add final styling touches
- [ ] Create documentation for the MVP
- [ ] Prepare demo script and sample data
- [ ] Test the entire application flow

### Implementation Notes
- Create a concise user guide
- Document API endpoints
- Prepare a clear demonstration script
